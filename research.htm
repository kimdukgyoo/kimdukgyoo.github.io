<br>
This paper studies infinite-horizon sequential bargaining among <i>n</i> (>= 3) players in which the proposer---a player who proposes a distribution of an economic surplus---is randomly selected from the pool of potential proposers, and the current or previous proposers are excluded from the pool of potential proposers when the proposal is rejected and the game moves on to the next round, until every player has the same number of opportunities. To analyze the infinite-horizon model with a particular time dependency per each <i>n</i> rounds (a cycle,) I restrict my attention to the equilibrium characterization with the extended notion of stationarity, which I call a <i>cycle-stationary subgame perfect</i> (CSSP) equilibrium. The CSSP equilibrium is unique (with allowing mixed strategies of selecting coalition members at random) and analogous to some specific forms of finite-horizon bargaining. Even when there is no discount on delay, the proposer's share in equilibrium is strictly smaller than that predicted by the stationary equilibrium of the Baron--Ferejohn legislative bargaining model under a simple majority rule.</li>

<li><b>"One Bite at the Apple": Legislative Bargaining without Replacement</b>
<br>
To examine how a concern about fairness affects the bargaining outcomes, I modify the many-player "divide-the-dollar'' game in which previous proposers, players who were randomly selected in the previous rounds but failed to provide an accepted proposal, cannot propose again. This bargaining model without replacement yields a unique subgame perfect equilibrium which has two distinctive features: Under majority or unanimity, in equilibrium the first proposer keeps a constant share for herself <i>regardless of</i> the size of the legislature. Under unanimity, the first proposer keeps a <i>smaller</i> share than nonproposers when the discount factor is sufficiently large. Due to these features, the behavioral factors that could drive the bargaining outcomes in the laboratory can be identified. I find that proposers do not fully extract their rent, but a concern about fairness is not a driving factor of it. Out-of-equilibrium observations suggest that retaliation and the fear thereof can be a driving factor.

<div id="popuncertainty" style="display: none" class="abstract">
<p>I examine how the voluntary contribution of public goods is affected by uncertainty about the size of the relevant population. I show that when the number of players is random and each player only knows the population distribution, the voluntary contribution level in a Nash equilibrium is higher than when the number of players is fixed at the mean of the population distribution, if the marginal production of public goods is convex, and the agents are self-interested. I also show that the voluntary contribution level decreases as the expected number of players increases, but such a decreasing tendency is weaker than the prediction from the model with a certain population. With allowing the agents' social preferences in the form of the increasing concave warm-glow utility in the population size, I can show the theoretical predictions can be opposite when the production function is linear. The linear Voluntary Contributions Mechanism (VCM) can capture the relationships between the warm-glow and population uncertainty, and the nonlinear VCM with population uncertainty can provide a structural way to additionally examine theoretical predictions. The results from the lab experiments support many aspects of the theoretical predictions. The changes in contribution level is smaller under population uncertainty, and the low realization of the population distribution mainly determines the subjects' decisions. When the population distribution is more volatile subjects contribute more. It is a new and interesting observation that the salience of population uncertainty partly drive out warm-glow.</p></li>

<div id="stc" style="display: none" class="abstract">
<p>Winner-take-all competitions can lead to the person in the second-tier environment having the worst expected payoff when players exclusively choose their environment and exert effort before their random and heterogeneous environmental supports are realized. Tier is defined by the rank of pairwise competitions. The Second-Tier Trap (STT) is a situation in which a player from the second-tier environment gets the worst expected payoff even though his expected environmental support is strictly greater than the third-tier player's. A sufficient condition for the STT is that the ex-ante advantages, the winning probabilities when every player from each environment exerts the same amount of effort, are the same for both environments. I claim that the sufficient condition for the STT is so weak that players can be easily tempted to choose the second-tier environment, which is a wrong decision. Lab experiments verify this claim. In two-stage all-pay auction games whose structure generates the STT, subjects chose an environment and then an effort level. For four rounds (called the unrestricted rounds) they choose one among three environments, and for six rounds (the restricted rounds) they are not allowed to choose the first-tier environment. No subjects chose the optimal environment for all restricted rounds, while 58.33% of subjects did so for all unrestricted rounds. On average, subjects choose the optimal environment for 29.86% of all restricted rounds and for 79.95% of all unrestricted rounds. Those who choose the optimal environment for all unrestricted rounds were more likely to fall into the STT.</p>

<p>Volden and Wiseman (2007) consider legislative bargaining when particularistic and collective goods coexist. Though Volden and Wiseman (2008) correct their equilibrium characterization, the details about stationarity should be examined further. The responders, who vote on the proposer's distributional plan, should have the voting decision rules based on the payoff function (captured mainly by the value of the particularistic goods relative to that of the collective goods), not based on the form of the division between the amounts allocated to the two types of goods, where the form was chosen by a formateur. However, the stationary equilibrium presented by Volden and Wiseman consists of time- and history-independent, but proposal-form-dependent strategies. I present another stationary subgame perfect equilibrium where stationary strategies are time-, history-, and proposal-form-independent. This correction changes the qualitative nature of the equilibrium: The collective goods provision is weakly <i>monotone</i> decreasing with respect to the relative value of particularistic goods over collective goods. Experimental evidence from Frechette et al. (2012) fits with the corrected equilibrium characterization.</p></li>

<li>Economic Conservatism of The Poor: The Low Demand for Redistribution [<a id="conservativepoor_link" href="javascript:expandIt('conservativepoor')">View Abstract</a>] [<!--<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/y7w0k1sd55bmg61/EconomicConservatismofThePoor.pdf?dl=0"target="_blank"> View Paper </a>-->under revision]<div id="conservativepoor" style="display: none" class="abstract">
<p>Two observations, that some lower income citizens do not demand redistribution (Veblen (1899)) and, as income inequality gets severer, a larger proportion of them demands economic redistribution less (Kelly and Enns (2010)), are counter-intuitive in that people oppose redistribution which could be beneficial to themselves. Understanding the main driving factor that leads to economic conservatism of the poor is crucial as it guides how policymakers should design redistribution. I show that positional concern can be one of the main factors. When citizens care for their relative position on consumption, and their labor productivity is slightly perturbed if a new tax policy is implemented, only the middle income citizens may vote for the redistribution policy. The low income citizens may vote against when the expected utility gain from redistribution in absolute terms is smaller than the expected disutility from the possibility of losing a current relative position due to a productivity shock. Compared to the prospect of upward mobility hypothesis, I provide a testable prediction for the relationship between economic inequality and economic conservatism of the poor. If positional concern is the main driving factor, policymakers should focus on increasing the low income citizens' standard of living to the middle class, while the prospect of upward mobility is main, they should focus on minimizing income gaps.</p></li>

<div id="coin" style="display: none" class="abstract">
<p>I asked a cooperative charity whose headquarters is located in Seoul, South Korea, to send 16,000 solicitation letters of four different types, with each having a different attachment (no attachment, 100 Korean won, 500 won, and 500-won sized medallion), in order to better understand the philanthropy initiatives and individuals' social preferences by collecting responses and comparing them by letter type. They received one donation and 381 `active' returns in eight weeks. The real coin attachment, though some charities including UNICEF have used this `coin strategy,' did not bring a significantly positive effect. A sense of involuntarily indebtedness does not seem to be one of the major driving forces behind reciprocity. The coin attachment appeals to the potential donor's inequity aversion: A significantly larger proportion of mail recipients returned the letter with 100 Korean won than those with no attachment. I also claim that the results from the previous studies which select solicitation recipients from the existing database should be extrapolated with extra care due to the sample selection bias.</p></li>

<li>"One Bite at the Apple": Legislative Bargaining without Replacement [<a id="bargain_link" href="javascript:expandIt('bargain')">View Abstract</a>] (Draft available upon request)<div id="bargain" style="display: none" class="abstract">
<p>This paper studies sequential bargaining among n >= 3 players (n odd) in which agents recognized as the proposer in the current or previous rounds are excluded from the pool of potential proposers in the next round. While the standard legislative bargaining model suffers from issues caused by numerous equilibria, this bargaining model without replacement yields a unique equilibrium which has two distinctive features: Under majority or unanimity, in equilibrium the first proposer keeps a constant share for herself <i>regardless of</i> the size of the legislature. Under unanimity, the first proposer keeps a <i>smaller</i> share than nonproposers when the discount factor is sufficiently large. Due to this proposer disadvantage and the uniqueness of the equilibrium, as well as the fact that the proposer share is constant in the size of the legislature, testing of these theoretical predictions in the laboratory provides a clearer interpretation. I find that proposers do not fully extract their rent, and that this is due not to a concern about fairness but rather to the uncertainty in the amount that coalition members are willing to accept. Out-of-equilibrium observations suggest that retaliation and the fear thereof may be another driving factor.

<li>Mixing Propensity and Strategic Decision Making (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hckim0822/research-and", target=blank>Heechun Kim</a>) [<a id="coin_link" href="javascript:expandIt3('mixingpropensity')">View Proposal</a>] <div id="mixingpropensity" style="display: none" class="abstract">
<p>A growing number of studies in economics and political science consider bounded rationality both in decision making and in strategic behavior. In decision making, rationality of individuals may be limited by the cognitive limitations of their minds. Individuals' strategic behaviors are also away from theoretical predictions with full rationality assumption, not only because their rationality is limited but also because <i>their belief about other individuals' bounded rationality</i> varies. Our primary goal is to examine how individuals form and reflect beliefs about other individuals' bounded rationality. In a strategic situation where an economic agent earns more when she predicts other agents' cognition levels more accurately, being fully rational or being completely irrational cannot maximize her payoff. Therefore, observing economic agent's strategic decisions may help us to identify her cognition level and, eventually, to identify a full map of heterogeneous beliefs. Our main contribution is to explicitly consider individuals' heterogeneity in reflecting their belief into their behavior. By disentangling such heterogeneity from the belief per se, we are able to bridge two competing theories of strategic thinking (<i>Lk</i>, Level-<i>k</i> theory and CH, Cognitive Hierarchy) and delve the explanatory power of both theories. </p>
<p>In repetitive decision-making under uncertainty, experimental observations suggest that significant amount (more than 40%) of subjects do not make decisions to maximize their expected payoff, but match their decisions to the probability of events. (Rubinstein (2002), Neimark and Shuford (1959)) We call such individual tendency in repetitive decision-making as a <i>mixing propensity</i>. We claim that without taking individuals' heterogeneous mixing propensity into account, it is challenging to map individuals' strategic behaviors to their underlying belief. We build upon two leading theories formalizing bounded rationality in strategic thinking: the Level-k (Lk) model (Costa-Gomes et al. (2001), Costa-Gomes and Crawford (2006)) and the Cognitive Hierarchy (CH) model (Camerer et al. (2002, 2004).) Both models assume that individuals use only finite (=<i>k</i>) steps of iterative dominance, and such <i>k</i> varies by individual. One distinctive difference is that the Lk model assumes that individuals believe others' cognition level is homogeneous, while the CH model assumes that they believe it is mixed. To analyze experimental observations, they implicitly share an assumption that every subject does not have the mixing propensity, which may create sizable misinterpretation: An individual who has a certain type of mixing propensity may show homogeneous choice patterns even when she has a heterogeneous belief, while an individual who has another mixing propensity may make heterogeneous choice patterns that fully reflect her heterogeneous belief when the best response to the belief is a probabilistic mixture of many choices.</p></li>

<li>Public Announcement Under Rational Ignorance (with Yeochang Yoon) [<a id="bias_link" href="javascript:expandIt3('bias')">View Proposal</a>] <div id="bias" style="display: none" class="abstract">
<p>We consider a model where one message-sender/query-respondent communicates with many message-recipients/query-senders. The message sender provides a public good as a form of announcement, a set of responses that answer some of potential queries, also provides a private good as a form of personal concierge service that directly answer any particular query. Message recipients are heterogeneous in terms of query, which is randomly drawn from a commonly known distribution. They learn their query and the size of announcement, decide whether to pay attention to the announcement, and purchase a private ticket for concierge service whose price is ex-post determined by the number of people purchased the ticket, when necessary. Message recipients' objective is to know the answer of their query with a minimum cost, and the message sender's objective is to make every recipient be answered while minimizing the overall communication costs.</p>
<p>This communication process is hard to achieve efficiency. The inefficiency can be summarized by underprovided public goods and overpriced private goods in equilibrium. The main driving force behind the inefficiency is that the agents who draw some query neither too general nor too specific, have an incentive not to pay attention to the announcement due to the possibility of paying both costs, while other agents are more likely pay only one of two costs. In other words, comparing to the case where the message sender knows all recipients' query, there are more free-riders who do not pay attention to the announcement.</p>

<li>The Salience of Positive Externality of Vaccination (Title subject to change) [<a id="vaccination_link" href="javascript:expandIt3('vaccination')">View Proposal</a>]
<div id="vaccination" style="display: none" class="abstract">
<p>
Will the salience of positive externality of self-protection make people behave in a more self-protective way? I propose to conduct controlled lab experiments to observe how the information framing on the infection probability of a communicable disease affects an individual's decision about self-protection. Many theoretical studies have addressed the positive externality of self-protective actions (for example, vaccination at their own expense against a communicable disease or using condoms to prevent sexually transmitted diseases), claiming that self-protective behavior can decrease the possibility of infection, as well as the possibility of being a transmitter of the disease. In other words, taking no action may increase the possibility of transmitting the disease, and those who have a lower tolerance level, for example, the old, may more likely be infected. The studies have unequivocally claimed that the social value of self-protection had been under-estimated, but the policy suggestions followed by the claim vary. Compulsory vaccination may minimize the infection rates of the disease being targeted, but at the same time it does not guarantee that such a policy can always maximize social welfare because the social cost may not be affordable or the individual costs imposed by the policy may distort the individual's decisions on their resource allocation. Moreover, it may seem too paternalistic for some citizens. I would like to focus more on seeking the individual's voluntary actions that would accompany no or minimal social costs. In many contexts, it has been reported that the framing on the information for decision-making would change a subject's behavior significantly. I hypothesize that when people recognize that their action does bring positive externality, then they would do self-protective actions more frequently than when they recognize only the personal benefits and cost. To the best of my knowledge, no field experiments with the purpose of this project have been conducted. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs), which have been important in the evaluation of treatments for non-infectious diseases, are less informative about treatment of communicable diseases. There are a few studies providing experimental results on self-protective actions, but those have not examined how the subject's social preferences affect their self-protective action.
