## Thesis Supervision

I am supervising Bachelor's and Master's theses on topics in microtheory-based public economics and political economy, broadly defined. I conduct lab experiments for my research, but I do not recommend students to do that. 

Try to answer the following questions before you contact me. It must help you to organize your thoughts.

1. What is your research question? (Wrong answer: "Previous papers did this and that, and I want to slightly extend them.")
2. Which method do you consider to answer your research question? " (Wrong answer: "I like theory, so I want to have some theoretical parts in my thesis.")

Contact me at least several weeks before your planned start date. 


### "Fast-Track" Bachelor's or Master's thesis

Sometimes I come up with random research questions that are curious enough to know the answer but not good enough to devote my time. I list them as potential ideas for a Bachelor's thesis. As you can see, those are pretty random, and sometimes have nothing to do with my research interests. If you pick and "successfully" accomplish it, you will expect to get grade 1.3.

- **Anti-vaxxers after a pandemic disease**: After a pandemic COVID-19, do anti-vaxxers get vaccinated, or strenthen their belief? A small theory on information acquisition combined with some empirical findings would be ideal.

- **Risk-taking after loss in competitions versus loss in payoff**: When you spend your resources to win a competition, it is possible that you win the competition but lose payoffs or you lose the competition but earn payoffs. How are their risk-taking behaviors affected after those events? A comprehensive literature review and a small-scale experiment would be ideal.

- **Pronouns in the economics papers**: Ariel Rubinstein, a famous microeconomist and an author of several textbooks, only uses male pronouns with claiming "...that continuous reminders of the he/she issue simply divert readersâ€™ attention. Language is of course important in shaping our thinking, but I feel it is more effective to raise the issue of discrimination against women in the discussion of "the issues" rather than raising flags on every page of a book on economic theory." At the same time, people may be afraid of being viewed as a male chauvinist by using male pronouns. How do economists use pronouns, and how does that pattern evolve over time? Can any interesting patterns (e.g., female authors use female pronouns more/less, or a particular literature use male/female pronouns for specific purposes) be found? Text analysis of the papers published in leading journals, along with a small network theory, would be ideal.

- **Population density, homogeneity, and conspicous consumptions**: If it is easier to compare your consumptions with others, due to high density of the city you live in, high usage of social media, or more similar people nearby, do you consume more conspicuous goods? 

- **Dictator dividing a loss among many**: If a dictator can allocate all the loss to one peron, or spread out the loss to many, how would the dictator do? When everyone has a typical loss aversion, allocating all the loss to one could be socially better. Of course, the other way can be justified. An online experiment would be sufficient.

- **Robustness checks on multilateral bargaining over the division losses**: There are two frequently-raised questions regarding the experimental design. The goal is to investigate whether the changes in the experimental design leads to different outcomes. I can fund the lab experiments. 

- **Self-image concern or misperception**: "Wobegon Lake effect" is a well-known phenomenon that majority people tend to believe that they are "better than the average" at everything. Many survey questions like "How well do you drive compared to the average driver?", "How well do you control yourself compared to the average person?", "How much do you like sugary beverages compared to the average person?" unilaterally indicate that the overall answers are skewed to the "better half". Is it because of the misperception, or because of the self-image concern? (Say, even if I know that I am terrible at self-control, but I don't want to reveal myself as such one, so I answer the question differently.) How can these two are distinguished?
