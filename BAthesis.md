## Thesis Supervision

I am supervising Bachelor's and Master's theses on topics in microtheory-based public economics and political economy, broadly defined. I conduct lab experiments for my research, but I do not recommend students to do that. 

Try to answer the following questions before you contact me. It must help you to organize your thoughts.

1. What is your research question? (Wrong answer: "Previous papers did this and that, and I want to slightly extend them.")
2. Which method do you consider to answer your research question? " (Wrong answer: "I like theory, so I want to have some theoretical parts in my thesis.")

Contact me at least several weeks before your planned start date. 


## "Fast-Track" Bachelor's thesis

Sometimes I come up with random research questions that are curious enough to know the answer but not good enough to devote my time. I list them as potential ideas for a Bachelor's thesis. As you can see, those are pretty random, and sometimes have nothing to do with my research interests. If you pick and "successfully" accomplish it, you will expect to get grade 1.3.

- **Anti-vaxxers after a pandemic disease**: After a pandemic COVID-19, do anti-vaxxers get vaccinated, or strenthen their belief? A small thory on information acquisition combined with some empirical findings would be ideal.

- **Risk-taking after loss in competitions versus loss in payoff**: When you spend your resources to win a competition, it is possible that you win the competition but lose payoffs or you lose the competition but earn payoffs. How are their risk-taking behaviors affected after those events? A comprehensive literature review and a small-scale experiment would be ideal.

- **Pronouns in the economics papers**: Ariel Rubinstein, a famous microeconomist and an author of several textbooks, only uses male pronouns with claiming "...that continuous reminders of the he/she issue simply divert readersâ€™ attention. Language is of course important in shaping our thinking, but I feel it is more effective to raise the issue of discrimination against women in the discussion of "the issues" rather than raising flags on every page of a book on economic theory." At the same time, people may be afraid of being viewed as a male chauvinist by using male pronouns. How do economists use pronouns, and how does that pattern evolve over time? Can any interesting patterns (e.g., female authors use female pronouns more/less, or a particular literature use male/female pronouns for specific purposes) be found? Text analysis of the papers published in leading journals, along with a small network theory, would be ideal.

- **Population density, homogeneity, and conspicous consumptions**: If it is easier to compare your consumptions with others, due to high density of the city you live in, high usage of social media, or more similar people nearby, do you consume more conspicuous goods?
