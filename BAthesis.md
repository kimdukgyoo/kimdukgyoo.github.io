## Thesis Supervision

I am supervising Bachelor's and Master's theses on topics in microtheory-based public economics and political economy, broadly defined. I conduct lab experiments for my research, but I do not recommend students to do that. 

Try to answer the following questions before you contact me. It must help you to organize your thoughts.
(1) What is your research question? (Wrong answer: "Previous papers did this and that, and I want to slightly extend them.")
(2) Which method do you consider to answer your research question? " (Wrong answer: "I like theory, so I want to have some theoretical parts in my thesis.")

Contact me at least several weeks before your planned start date. 


## "Fast-Track" Bachelor's thesis

Sometime I come up with research questions but I list potential ideas for a Bachelor's thesis. If you pick and "successfully" accomplish it, you will expect to get grade 1.3.
